# SwitchBot (BLE) adapter for ioBroker

![Number of Installations](http://iobroker.live/badges/switchbot-ble-installed.svg)
[![github-workflow](https://github.com/mrbungle64/iobroker.switchbot-ble/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mrbungle64/iobroker.ecovacs-deebot)

This adapter allows you to control your SwitchBot "Bot" and to monitor SwitchBot "Meter", "Contact" and "Motion" via Bluetooth (BLE).

## Before you install

If you are looking for Hub Plus/Mini support, [this adapter](https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker.switchbot-hub) is what you will need.

## Models

### Supported models

* SwitchBot "Bot"
* SwitchBot "Contact"
* SwitchBot "Motion"
* SwitchBot "Meter"
* SwitchBot "Meter Plus"
* SwitchBot "Indoor/Outdoor Hygrometer"

The models listed are those that I have in use myself.

#### Other models

* SwitchBot "Curtain"

These models are known to work, but I don't have them in use myself.

## Prerequisites

To use this adapter, you will need to already have [ioBroker](iobroker.net) installed.

### Supported OS

This adapter may only run on Linux-based operating systems,
as the underlying library [node-switchbot](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/node-switchbot#supported-os)
currently only supports Linux-based operating systems such as Raspbian and Ubuntu.

Before installing the adapter, you need to install some Linux libraries related to Bluetooth.
These are as follows if the operating system is Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
```

You also have to run the following command:

```bash
$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```

This grants the `node` binary `cap_net_raw` privileges, so it can start/stop BLE advertising.

__Note:__ The above command requires `setcap` to be installed.
It can be installed the following way (e.g. Raspbian and Ubuntu):

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
```

See the documentation of [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#readme) for other details.

### Node.js

It is recommended to use version 16.x or 18.x of [Node.js](nodejs.org).

The minimum required version is 16.x, but support for this version may will be dropped soon.

## Installation

```bash
$ cd /opt/iobroker/
$ npm install iobroker.switchbot-ble
```

## Usage

### Remarks

#### SwitchBot "Bot"

If you use the "Bot" in "Switch Mode"
the value of the state "control.inverseOnOff" should be the same as "Inverse the on/off direction" in the app.
This cannot be synchronized automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If the adapter no longer works, e.g. after a restart or system update, please try the following:

```bash
$ cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.switchbot-ble/
$ sudo rm -r node_modules/
$ npm install
$ sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```

* The battery levels are only approximate values
