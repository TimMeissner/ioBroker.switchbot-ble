# Switchbot (BLE) adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows you to control your SwitchBot "Bot" and to monitor the temperature/humidity from SwitchBot "Meter" via Bluetooth (BLE).

## Before you install

* It only supports SwitchBot "Bot" and "Meter" via Bluetooth (BLE)
* Controlling SwitchBot "Bot" may not be 100% stable (see known issues)
* If you are looking for Hub Plus/Mini support, [this adapter](https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker.switchbot-hub) is what you will need

## Supported OS

This adapter may only run on Linux-based operating systems, as the underlying library [node-switchbot](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/node-switchbot#supported-os) currently only supports Linux-based operating systems such as Raspbian and Ubuntu.

## Installation

It is recommended to use version 12.x or 14.x of Node.js.

The minimum required version is still 10.x, **but that will change soon**.

Before installing the adapter, some linux libraries related Bluetooth as follows if the OS is Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian.

```
$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
```

See the documentation of [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#readme) for other operating systems details.

If the adapter starts but won't connect to your bluetooth hardware, you need to give `node` additional permissions:
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
which requires `libcap2-bin` to be installed.

## Models

### Supported models

* SwitchBot "Bot"
* SwitchBot "Meter"

#### Other models (untested)

* SwitchBot "Curtain" (read-only)

States should also be generated for other models (e.g. Contact Sensor, Humidifier),
but they are also read-only and only contain information about the battery level and model.

## Known issues

* "press", "turnOn" and "turnOff" from SwitchBot "Bot" sometimes not working
  * There's no solution for this yet, because there's mostly no error message. It just doesn't move the arm
  * However, it may be that in many cases it still works without any issues

## Troubleshooting

If the adapter no longer works, e.g. after a restart or system update, please try the following:

```bash
cd /opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.switchbot-ble/
sudo rm -r node_modules/
npm install
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
