# Switchbot (BLE) adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows you to control your SwitchBot "Bot" and to monitor the temperature/humidity from SwitchBot "Meter".

## Before you install
* This adapter doesn't support Hub Plus/Mini
* It only supports "SwitchBot Bot" and "SwitchBot Meter" over Bluetooth (BLE)
* Controlling "SwitchBot Bot" isn't stable yet (see known issues)
* The "SwitchBot Meter" isn't tested yet but should work anyway

## Dependencies
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10 +
* [switchbot](https://github.com/ukiuni/Switchbot) for moving the arm from SwitchBot "Bot"
* [node-switchbot](https://github.com/futomi/node-switchbot) for monitoring the states of your SwitchBot "Bot" and "Meter"

## Supported OS
[node-switchbot](https://github.com/futomi/node-switchbot) currently supports only Linux-based OSes, such as Raspbian, Ubuntu, and so on.

## Installation
Before installing the adapter, some linux libraries related Bluetooth as follows if the OS is Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian.

```
$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
```

If the adapter starts but won't connect to your bluetooth hardware, you need to give `node` additional permissions:
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
which requires `libcap2-bin` to be installed.

## Models

### Supported models
* SwitchBot "Bot"

### These models should work
* SwitchBot "Meter" (Thermometer & Hygrometer)

## Known issues

* "press", "turnOn" and "turnOff" from SwitchBot "Bot" sometimes not working.
  * There's no solution for this yet, because there's mostly no error message. It just doesn't move the arm.
  * When using [node-switchbot](https://github.com/futomi/node-switchbot) for controlling the "Bot" the connection is even more unstable.

## Changelog
