# Switchbot (BLE) adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows you to control your SwitchBot "Bot" and to monitor the temperature/humidity from SwitchBot "Meter".

## Before you install

* This adapter doesn't support Hub Plus/Mini
* It only supports "SwitchBot Bot" and "SwitchBot Meter" over Bluetooth (BLE)
* Controlling "SwitchBot Bot" isn't 100% stable yet (see known issues)

## Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10 +
* [switchbot](https://github.com/ukiuni/Switchbot) for moving the arm from SwitchBot "Bot"
* [node-switchbot](https://github.com/futomi/node-switchbot) for monitoring the states of your SwitchBot "Bot" and "Meter"

## Supported OS

[node-switchbot](https://github.com/futomi/node-switchbot) currently supports only Linux-based OSes, such as Raspbian, Ubuntu, and so on.

## Installation

It is recommended to use version 12.x or 14.x of Node.js.

The minimum required version is still 10.x, **but that will change soon**.

Before installing the adapter, some linux libraries related Bluetooth as follows if the OS is Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian.

```
$ sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez libbluetooth-dev libudev-dev
```

See the documentation of [@abandonware/noble](https://github.com/abandonware/noble#readme) for other operating systems details.

If the adapter starts but won't connect to your bluetooth hardware, you need to give `node` additional permissions:
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f `which node`)
```
which requires `libcap2-bin` to be installed.

## Models

### Supported models

* SwitchBot "Bot"
* SwitchBot "Meter"

#### Other models (untested)

* SwitchBot "Curtain" (read-only)

States should also be generated for other models (e.g. Contact Sensor, Humidifier),
but they are also read-only and only contain information about the battery level and model.

## Known issues

* "press", "turnOn" and "turnOff" from SwitchBot "Bot" sometimes not working
  * There's no solution for this yet, because there's mostly no error message. It just doesn't move the arm
  * However, it may be that in many cases it still works without any issues
